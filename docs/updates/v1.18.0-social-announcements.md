# 🏎️ CTR Kart v1.18.0 - Major Racing Update

Hey racers! We just shipped a big update to CTR Kart.

## ⚡ TL;DR
- Curves now feel realistic (slow in → boost out)
- Wall hits show smoke effects
- Stuck karts auto-recover
- Everything is 20% faster
- UI polish across the board

## 🎮 What This Means For You
The track is the same, but how you drive matters more. Good drivers will nail curve exits for speed boosts. Bad drivers will feel the difference too—but at least you won't get stuck anymore!

## 🐛 Fixed
- Track borders look clean now
- Health bar actually matches the percentage
- Various TypeScript fixes

Go race! 🏁
